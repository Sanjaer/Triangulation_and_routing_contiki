# Triangulation_and_routing_contiki
Developed by Jokin Sáinz (jokin.sainz@gmail.com), Raúl Ruiz Bueno and Pablo San José Burgos for the subject "Ubiquitous systems" of MSc Embedded Systems Engineering (University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU)

## Brief
Development of a positioning system using Contiki.
Three kinds of device: 
- Beacons
- Nodes
- Sinks

In a space where the position of the beacons is known and the nodes can move freely, we implemented a positioning system for the nodes using triangulation via the broadcast messages of the beacon, and a routing system for the positioning data stored in the nodes via the beacons to the central Sink.
